# Continuous Test-Time Domain Adaptation in Real-Time Bidding

This repository contains the code and resources for the project **"Continuous Test-Time Domain Adaptation in Real-Time Bidding."** The project investigates the application of Continuous Test-Time Adaptation (CoTTA) across various Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models within Real-Time Bidding (RTB) environments.

## Datasets
- **iPinYou Dataset**: Detailed information on the iPinYou dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/wnzhang/make-ipinyou-data). 
- **YOYI Dataset**: The YOYI dataset is available [here](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/datasets/7).

## Usage

To get started, please follow the instructions for data preprocessing and training the baseline models. Materials and scripts for each experiment are contained in separate folders, organized to facilitate easy setup and execution.

## Requirements
- **Operating System**: WSL2 with Ubuntu 22.04.1
- **Python**: Version 3.10.12
- **PyTorch**: Version 2.3.1
